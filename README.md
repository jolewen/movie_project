# Movie Project
Demo for Movie Project I &amp; II

## STAGE I: 
Movie Database with CRUD methods & basic analytics

## STAGE II: 
Introduction of complexity in data structure & OOP 

## How to run
For all modules when run, the working directory 
is assumed to be project root, i.e. the directory of this README.md and the main.py.
This ensures relative path consistency across all methods, 
as well as easier containerization into Docker.
