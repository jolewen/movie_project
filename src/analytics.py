# Methods to receive basic analytics about the movie database

"""Stats
Print statistics about the movies in the database:
* Average rating in the database.
* Median rating in the database. Read about median, and notice the difference between even number of movies and odd number of movies.
* The best movie by rating. If there are multiple movies with the maximum rate, print all of them.
* The worst movie by rating. If there are multiple movies with the minimum rate, print all of them.
